# Docker Browser Test Environment

This repository contains a Docker setup for a browser environment with VNC access, optimized for multi-architecture builds.

## Features
- Ubuntu 22.04 with XFCE4 desktop environment
- Chromium browser pre-installed and configured
- Python 3.11, Node.js 22, and Yarn
- VNC server for remote desktop access
- Screen lock/screensaver disabled for uninterrupted operation
- Multi-architecture support (AMD64 and ARM64)

## Prerequisites

This project uses Docker BuildX to create images that run on both Intel/AMD (amd64) and Apple Silicon (arm64) architectures.

- **Docker with BuildX**: Ensure you have a recent version of Docker installed. Docker Desktop (Mac/Windows) includes BuildX by default. On Linux, you may need to install or enable it separately.

## Building the Image

The included `build-multi-arch.sh` script automates the build process.

1.  **Set the Version**: Before building, update the `VERSION` file in this directory with the desired semantic version (e.g., `1.2.0`). This file is the single source of truth for versioning.

2.  **Run the Build Script**: The script will automatically read the `VERSION` file and tag the image accordingly.

    **For Local Development (Default):**
    Running the script without any flags will build the image for your machine's architecture and load it directly into your local Docker daemon.
    ```bash
    # Build for your local architecture and load into Docker
    ./build-multi-arch.sh
    ```
    The image will then be available in `docker images`.

    **For Publishing:**
    To build the multi-architecture image and push it to Docker Hub, use the `--push` flag. This requires you to be logged in via `docker login` first.
    ```bash
    # Build for all supported architectures and push to Docker Hub
    ./build-multi-arch.sh --push
    ```

    **Other Options:**
    ```bash
    # Perform a clean build with no cache
    ./build-multi-arch.sh --no-cache
    ```

### First-Time BuildX Setup / Troubleshooting

The `build-multi-arch.sh` script attempts to create and use a dedicated BuildX builder named `multi-platform-builder`. If you encounter issues, you may need to run these setup commands manually.

1.  **Create a builder** (if it doesn't exist):
    ```bash
    docker buildx create --name multi-platform-builder --use
    ```

2.  **Enable QEMU for cross-platform emulation** (required for first-time setup):
    ```bash
    docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
    ```

### Verifying the Multi-Architecture Build

After pushing an image, you can verify that it supports multiple architectures with the following command:

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect autobyteus/chrome-vnc:latest
```
The output should list both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` under "Manifests".

## Running a Standalone Container

After building the image locally or pulling it from Docker Hub, you can easily start a standalone container for direct use or testing.

1.  **Use the Run Script:** The included `run-container.sh` script is the recommended way to start the container. It will automatically use your locally built image or pull from Docker Hub if a local version isn't found.
    ```bash
    ./run-container.sh
    ```

2.  **Accessing the Container:** Once started, you can access the container's desktop environment:
    *   **VNC:** Connect your VNC client to `localhost:5900` (or your custom port). No password is required.
    *   **Chrome Debugging:** The browser's remote debugging port is available at `localhost:9223` (or your custom port).

3.  **Customization and Troubleshooting Port Conflicts:**
    If you get a "port is already allocated" error, you can specify different host ports using flags:

    ```bash
    # Run VNC on host port 5901 and the debug port on 9224
    ./run-container.sh --vnc-port 5901 --debug-port 9224
    ```

    You can also specify a custom tag or container name:
    ```bash
    # Run a specific version and give the container a custom name
    ./run-container.sh --tag 1.2.0 --name my-custom-container
    ```
